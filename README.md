# Kaggle Dataset API & Parameterized Plot Functions in Python

This Python Notebook demonstrates how to access a dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API and create custom plots utilizing the [Parameterized Plot Functions](https://github.com/MrFickle/Parameterized-Plot-Functions-in-Python) repository.

## Key Features
1. **Set up Kaggle API**:
   - Generate your Kaggle API token from your Kaggle account.
   - Upload the `kaggle.json` file to authenticate and download datasets.
   - An example of a Kaggle dataset download code is included.

2. **Parameterized Plot Functions**:
   - Clone and use the plotting functions from the [Parameterized Plot Functions](https://github.com/MrFickle/Parameterized-Plot-Functions-in-Python.git) repository.
   - Customize the plots based on dataset requirements.

## Running on Google Colab
This notebook is intended to run on [**Google Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com) for ease of setup and access to necessary libraries and datasets.

Enjoy exploring the data and creating powerful visualizations!
